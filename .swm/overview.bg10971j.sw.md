KDBindings is a library that provides data binding and reactive programming utilities, allowing for efficient communication and synchronization between different parts of an application.

# Main Components

### Core Library (<SwmPath>[src/](src/)</SwmPath>)

The Core Library in KDBindings provides the fundamental building blocks for creating and managing bindings between properties and signals. It includes essential components such as property updaters, connection evaluators, and node operators, which facilitate the seamless interaction and synchronization of data within the application.
